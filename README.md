# Zed Workspaces for Command Palette

## Overview

This project provides an unofficial PowerToys command palette extension for opening recent Zed projects.

## How It Works

The extension parses Zed's local sqlite database file to find information about the most recently used workspaces and provides a way to launch them through Zed.

## Installation

> **Note:** This extension requires [Microsoft PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld) to be installed.

### Manual installation
- Download the MSIX installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/acieslewicz/ZedWorkspacesForCommandPalette/releases) section and run it
